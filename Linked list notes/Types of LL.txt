There are 4 type's of linked list, but in general we use 3 type's only:-

Singly-linked list: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null

Doubly-linked list: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
