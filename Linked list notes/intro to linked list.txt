What is linked list ?
Linked list is an linear data structure, which consists of a group of nodes in a sequence [OR] Linked list in which we store data in linear from!
But, Array also stores data in linear form. Then what's the difference!
In array we have to first define the size of the Array
Let's say:-
int arr[] = new int[8]
Array :- [10, 20, 15, 18, 16, 10, 20, 16]
And each bit has it's memory address, where 1 bit size = 4, therefore 8 bit = 8 * 4 = 32 bit.
But linked list is dynamic, we don't have to define it's size.
 
In linked list we can add element as many as we want. But, in array size is fixed. So, to add new element we have to create a new array!
 
     Advantages                                              DisAdvantages

1. Dynamic Nature                                   1. More memory usage due to address pointer
2. Optimal insertion & deletion                     2. Slow traversal compared to arrays
3. Stack's & queues can be easily implemented       3. No reverse traversal in singly linked list
4. No memory wastage                                4. No random access
